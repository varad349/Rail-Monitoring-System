# Rail Monitoring System

A Flutter application for real-time monitoring of rail systems using sensor data. This project leverages a WebSocket connection to fetch live sensor readings—including temperature, humidity, accelerometer, acoustic sound, and gyroscope data—and displays the information using a combination of charts, gauges, and maps. The app is built with a dark-themed UI and leverages several Flutter packages to deliver an interactive and responsive user experience.
